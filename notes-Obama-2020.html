		<blockquote>All of this pulled me in different directions. It was as if,
		because of the very strangeness of my heritage and the worlds I straddled,
		I was from everywhere and nowhere at once, a combination of ill-fitting
		parts, like a platypus or some imaginary beast, confined to a fragile
		habitat, unsure of where I belonged. And I sensed, without fully
		understanding why or how, that unless I could stitch my life together and
		situate myself along some firm axis, I might end up in some basic way
		living my life alone.</blockquote>
